There were so many guys gathered in WHUT-Linuxer QQ chat room.
One day a freshman joined in and began to ask me,
Hi, what's Linux? What's Linux for?
How old are you? Have you been in love? I asked.
I am single and i am ready to start the fourth year of my campus life. He replyed.

Linux is never too late to learn. Keeping a balanced life is more important.
Try to make a girl friend first. Buddy. I told him.
